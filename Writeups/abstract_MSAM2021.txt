Measuring the Effects of Starting Pitching

Betting on baseball is challenging.  One feature that makes the sport different is that moneylines usually list probable starting pitchers.  To take advantage of this, we develop a generalized linear mixed effects model using retrosheet data from several seasons.  The model includes effects for teams, starting pitchers, and venue.  Being able to assess a pitcher's performance independent of his team is also challenging.  By estimating effects for each starting pitcher, fitting the model provides another way to measure a starting pitcher's effectiveness.  In this talk we also provide some background on pitching metrics that have been used in the past, such as ERA, FIP, and opponent WOBA, and compare these metrics to our estimated pitcher effects.
