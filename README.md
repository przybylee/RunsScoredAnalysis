Betting on baseball is challenging.  One feature unique to the sport is that moneylines usually list probable starting pitchers.  To take advantage of this, we develop a generalized linear mixed effects model using retrosheet data from several seasons.  The model includes effects for teams, starting pitchers, and venue.  Being able to assess a pitcher's performance independent of his team is also challenging.  By estimating effects for each starting pitcher, fitting the model provides another way to measure a starting pitcher's effectiveness.  In this research we also provide some background on popular pitching metrics, such as ERA, FIP, and opponent WOBA, and compare these metrics to our estimated pitcher effects.  As was done with FIP back in 2001, we also investigate how well these starting pitcher effects reflect an individual pitchers performance by looking at their correlation across seasons.
