# RawData

This data was pulled from https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/mlb/mlboddsarchives.htm.  For seasons 2020 and earlier, pitcher names are given in all caps, first initial, lastname, and -R or -L indicating which arm they throw with.  For season 2021, the -R is ommitted.
